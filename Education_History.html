    <P>
        I started my Education journey in 2007 and by then i was in primary one <strong>P1</strong> at <strong>BISHOP DDUNGU P/S</strong> 
        to my primary seven <strong>P7</strong> and that was 2013. And this is where i attended my seven years duration of study in primary.
    </P>
    <p>I moved to <strong>KIBULI SECONDARY SCHOOL </strong> in 2014 and this is where i had both my <strong>A & O LEVELS</strong> for more six years .</p>
    <p>Then had my vacation for 1 year and the two years went for Arabic studies and then later i joined <strong>MAKERERE UNIVERSITY </strong> for my <strong>BACHELORS DEGREE IN SOFTWARE ENGINEERING </strong>  and this is to take me a duration of <strong>4 years </strong> which means inshaAllah i will be done by <strong>2016</strong> if all goes well .</p>
